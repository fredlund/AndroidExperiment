Bugs
====
- does not seem to find host when only db_host is set
- don't repeat downloads when download is pressed; failed ones are failed and can maybe be continued
but then when asked for
- why are file transfers sometimes short?

Features
========
- status reports for file transfers
- specifying port?
- quicker reading (in memory?)
- better searching: search insensitive, avoid .-directories, -pattern, etc

1. A set of must match (and),
and a set of must not match (not): first evaluate ands (in order),
      	     	      	    	   then nots (in order)
.java
biggles .epub
biggles -mobi
src -gradle
we cannot do:
biggles :or(.mobi,.epub)

2. A set of must match (and),
alternatively written :and(t1,...,tn)
where each must match can be a disjunction :or(simple1,...,simplen)
and a set of negative terms :not(simple1):
first evaluate simple positives (if any)
then evalute composite terms (if any)
and then evaluate negative terms

order terms (also in subterms)
execute term-by-term
return result

3. A completely general one:
question how to do this efficiently?
(we distribute not over operators and do positive ones first:
not(X and Y) => not(X) or not(Y)
not(X or Y) => not(X) and not(Y)
