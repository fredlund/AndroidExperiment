Bugs
====
- to match /..../dirname we should do dir dirname path /....
We should probably do the match not on the directory define but on the directory ref,
otherwise matching at the beginning (e.g., - ( dir ^ .) does not work).
And we have path for matching against the path.

Features
========
- show previous default library
- print library when asking for password
- status reports for file transfers
- better searching:
    avoid .-directories
    avoid .-files
- properties info about (last longclicked) file from menu
- handle device rotate
- maybe do matching based on file size
- maybe add file date to locatedb
- hide hidden dirs:
    - ( dir ^. )
- hide hidden files:
    - ( file ^ . )
- hide both:
    - ^ .
